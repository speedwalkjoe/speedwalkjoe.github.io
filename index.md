# I am Joseph Hughes.
I like to walk fast. I also have an interest in **web development** and learning about ancient manuscripts.

## Work Experience
I currently work as a **web intern** at Southern Virginia University. I clean up some things on the [school website](https://svu.edu), design new Wordpress Blocks in php, and whip up new pages.

## Classwork
At SVU, I'm studying for a Computer Science major – Full Stack Development Track. I'm also working towards a Writing & Communications minor.
In my Computer Science classes, I am learning:
- Python
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React and Django

## Hobbies
### Running
I run cross country and track. You can see my personal records for cross country [here](https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/8620595/Southern_Virginia/Joseph_Hughes.html) and personal records for track [here](https://xc.tfrrs.org/athletes/8683712/Southern_Virginia/Joseph_Hughes).

### Deseret Alphabet (𐐔𐐯𐑅𐐨𐑉𐐯𐐻 𐐈𐑊𐑁𐐪𐐺𐐯𐐻)
I can read and write in the Deseret Alphabet fluently. I find the ingenuity and innovation of this phonetic alphabet created by frontier American pioneers inspiring.
